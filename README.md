## Customer Churn Prediction using ANN:

This project is a web-based application for predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Built using Streamlit, this app allows users to input customer details and get real-time predictions on whether a customer is likely to churn.

## Features:

Predicts churn based on customer information.

Clean, interactive user interface built with Streamlit.

Dynamic input form for customer attributes.

Visualizations including heatmaps and boxplots for data exploration.

Trained using TensorFlow ANN and preprocessed with scikit-learn.

Supports model persistence using .h5 and .pkl files.


## How to Run:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git

cd Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows

## Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Overview:

Architecture: 3-layer ANN with ReLU activations and dropout regularization.

Training Data: Preprocessed Telco Customer Churn dataset.

Output: Binary classification (Churn / No Churn).

Performance: 79% accuracy on test data.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Included:

Correlation heatmap.

Boxplot of monthly charges by churn status.

More can be added via Streamlit as needed.

## Requirements:

See requirements.txt or install key dependencies:

pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn tensorflow seaborn matplotlib joblib

## âœ… Future Improvements:

Add SHAP explainability for predictions.

Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or other hosting service.

Save prediction history to database or CSV.

Add model training interface to web app.
